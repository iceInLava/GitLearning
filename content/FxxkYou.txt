The ChatGPT model is a pre trained language model developed by OpenAI. Its core algorithm is Transformer, which is a deep neural network structure based on self attention
 mechanism and has strong sequence modeling and representation learning abilities. Through the process of pre training and fine tuning, ChatGPT model can understand and
 generate natural language text, and play a role in various application scenarios, such as automatic question answering, intelligent customer service, voice recognition, machine
 translation, etc.
